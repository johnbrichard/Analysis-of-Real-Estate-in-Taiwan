# Analysis-of-Real-Estate-in-Taiwan
The objective of this experiment is to analyze the Real Estate Valuation Data Set and analyze which factors in the dataset contribute most to the home pricing and attempt to predict the valuations using a regression model.  

The tools used for this analysis will include the Python programming language, pandas module, and sklearn module. The pandas module will assist with handling our data from ingestion to cleaning and general data manipulation tasks. The sklearn module will assist in our statistical efforts such as determining our variable distribution and normalization of our data as well as our regression analysis.
